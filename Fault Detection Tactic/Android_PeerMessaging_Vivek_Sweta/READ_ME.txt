To make things easier, I have included two .apk files which can be downloaded into two android phones and used.

SERVER:
On starting the app you will see two buttons START and STOP, this is to start the server and stop, respectively. On starting the server you will see the "IP address" and the "Port number" on which the server is listening. This detail will become visible next to "Server Status"

Beside "Message" you will able to see the transmitted text.



CLIENT: 
This app will have three text fields, as below

Server IP to which message is supposed to transmit (Enter the IP displayed in SERVER app's IP ADDRESS)
NOTE: One time entery only

The port number of the server (Enter the port number displayed in SERVER app's PORT)
NOTE: One time entry only

The message to be sent (Enter any message to send)

Button "SEND MESSAGE" will send the message to the server. Can continously type any message and send to the server.

NOTE: [The apk can be downloaded into two seperate android phones into any folder, open the folder in your phone and click on the .apk file to install it into the android device]
